# Enhanced Blockchain-Based Decentralized Public Auditing for Cloud Storage

## Project Description
This project introduces a **Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol** specifically designed for **cloud storage**. By integrating **Blockchain**, **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**, and **Proxy Re-Encryption**, it ensures secure access, dynamic permission management, and data confidentiality, addressing the growing need for enhanced cloud security.

## Goal of the Project
- **Purpose**: Secure sensitive data stored in the cloud by preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity during both access and sharing.
- **Outcome**: Reduction in data breaches and improved confidence in cloud storage systems.

## Problem Solved
- **Challenge**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the cloud.
- **Solution**: A decentralized auditing system leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy for cloud storage.

## Features and Impact
### Key Functionalities:
- Anonymous access requests for users.
- Real-time data integrity verification.
- Dynamic permission management for secure data sharing.

### Outcomes:
- Enhanced data security and confidentiality.
- Positive user feedback on usability and trust.
- Significant reduction in data breaches, leading to safer cloud environments.

## Technologies and Tools Used
### Technologies:
- **Blockchain**: Decentralized transaction and auditing system.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Fine-grained access control mechanism.
- **Proxy Re-Encryption**: Secure sharing of encrypted data without exposing decryption keys.

### Tools:
- **ASP.NET**: Web application framework.
- **Visual C#**: Primary programming language.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio**: Integrated development environment.
